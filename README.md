## Snake Game ##
### This project resembles the famous phone game "Snake" that most of us have played at some point in our lives. ###
How to play:
* Run main.py
* Eat, get big, don't bump into the walls or the tail and try to achieve the highest score of anyone you know.
* The snake is controlled with up, down, left and right arrows from keyboard.  
####
This game came to life using turtle module, OOP concepts ( in particular, inheritance) and got the feature to remember the highest score due to working with files.
